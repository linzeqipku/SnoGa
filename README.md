    * Entities (e.g., classes, methods, commits, document sections, users, emails, issue reports and forum posts) are extracted from data and represented as labeled nodes.
    
    * Traces between entities are recovered automatically and represented as labled directed edges.
    
  * SnowGraph provides the support of graph query language and graphical browsing interface for the graph.
